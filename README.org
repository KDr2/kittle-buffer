#+TITLE: kittle-buffer

* Kittle Buffer

  Kittle Buffer, or KBF for short, is an extended Brainf**k
  implementation. KBF could also be explained as KDr2’s Brainf**k.

  This is a project I use to teach my kid, that's why I renamed it to
  eliminate the dirty word.

  I add some extensions to the vanilla BF:

  - Using a number for repetition, ~+23~ means repeating ~+~ for 23
    times. This works for ~+-<>~;
  - Multiple pointers support:
    - A pointer stack is added;
    - ~^~ for selecting pointer:
      - ~^N~ (N is an integer) selects the Nth pointer, and pushes the
        selected pointer onto the top of the pointer stack;
      - ~^~ (without any integer following it )selects the last selected
        pointer by popping the top pointer from the pointer stack.
  - ~@~ for calling a function:
    - A builtin function table is provided, each function in the table
      has an ID;
    - Before calling a function, we should push many pointers onto the
      pointer stack:
      - Where the return value should be placed;
      - Where the function ID is placed;
      - The pointers to the arguments, 0, 1, or more pointers are OK,
        here we call the arguments count ARITY;
      - Use @ARITY to call the function, calling a function won’t change
        the pointer stack.
  - ~!~ for input data, like what [[https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/][this BF visualizer]] does.

  It has a graphic user interface:

* How to use
  - install racket
  - clone the source, run ~raco pkg install~ in the project direcotry
  - run ~main.rkt~
    - ~racket main.rkt~ will start with the GUI;
    - ~racket main.rkt src.bf~ will run the BF/KBF code in the file ~src.bf~;
    - ~racket main.rkt -~ will read BF/KBF source from ~stdin~.

* The builtin function-table
  - 0: @1, identify, a function returns its only argument untouched.
  - 1: @1, outputs the number literally, instead of converting it to a
    char, returns the count of chars it has printed out.
  - 21: @2, +
  - 22: @1, @2, -
  - 23: @2, *
  - 24: @2, /
  - 25: @2, modulo
  - 26: @2, power, returns arg-0 raised to the power of arg-1.
  - 27: @2, =
  - 28: @2, >
  - 29: @2, <
  - 30: @2, >=
  - 31: @2, <=
  - 32: @2, bitwise or
  - 33: @2, bitwise and
  - 34: @2, bitwise xor
  - 35: @2, bitwise shift
  - 36: @2, random
* Examples
  The below code:
  #+begin_src text
    ^0^1>+21^2>>+50^3>3+47@2^0.
  #+end_src

  outputs ~a~.

  - ~^0~ pushes the pointer 0 to the pointer stack;
  - ~^1>+21~ pushes the pointer 1 to the pointer stack, moves it right
    for 1 step, then adds its value to 21 (21 is the function ~+~);
  - ~^2>>+50~ pushes the pointer 2 to the pointer stack, moves it
    right for 2 steps, then adds its value from 0 to 50;
  - ~^3>3+47~ pushes the pointer 3 to the pointer stack, moves it
    right for 3 steps, then adds its value from 0 to 47;
  - ~@2~ uses the top 2 pointers (^2 and ^3) as arguments, calls the
    function 21 to which the pointer 1 is pointing, places the return
    value (97 here) into the cell to which pointer 0 is pointing;
  - ~^0.~ selects pointer 0 and outputs the value it points to.
