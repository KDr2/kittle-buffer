Kittle Buffer, or KBF for short, is an extended Brainf**k
implementation. KBF could also be explained as KDr2â€™s Brainf**k.

This is a project I use to teach my kid, that's why I renamed it to
eliminate the dirty word.

I add some extensions to the vanilla BF:

- ~^~ for multiple pointers support;
- ~@~ for calling a function;
- Number for repetition, ~+23~ means repeating ~+~ for 23
  times. This works for ~+-<>~;
- ~!~ for input data, like what [[https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/][this BF visualizer]] does;
- ~?~ to set a break point under GUI mode.

Here is a simple demonstration of the GUI window:
